# Packaging Onboard-SDK-4.0

* The goal is to make as few custom changes to this repository as possible. 
* Consider making custom changes to one of our repos that extends this library.
* We forked this repository so we could provide debian binary packages for easy and consistent distributions.

Updating from DJI's origin is encouraged.  Branch from our master, then pull from their tag that you wish to merge.

Changes are currently found under two directories introduced by AM:

* debian/
* .github/

Let's keep it that way.


## Github Actions

.github/workflows contains custom workflows catering to an external development lifecycle. 

* Story branches remain the same and will produce release candidates in Cloudsmith
* Release branches release with every commit to master and do not participate in semantic commits (`feat:`,`fix:`,etc).  
    * Requires manual input of the major version by modifying the `.github/workflows/release.yml` whenever DJI does a major release.
        * Use their most recent [release tag](https://github.com/AutoModality/Onboard-SDK-4.0/releases) as the base
    * The build number is automatically appended to their major version to indicate AM additions: `4.0.0-AM${{ github.run_number }}` -> `4.0.0-AM3` for example.
    * In most cases, this will guarantee a unique package name in Cloudsmith

### ARM 64 Builder

We provide self hosted runners to build our ARM binaries, however, this can cause a [security threat](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security-with-public-repositories).  
For this reason, we only bring up the self hosted runner manually when builds need to happen, which should be rare.  
Organization action runners will not satisfy requirements since Github restricts such from the Org level, but allows at the repo level where we can apply granualar control. 

1. `ssh nvidia@192.168.4.135`
1. `/media/nvidia/build/actions-runners/Onboard-SDK-4.0/run.sh`
1. You should see `âˆš Connected to GitHub` and `Listening for Jobs`
1. You should see `arm-builder` available in the [repo's actions](https://github.com/AutoModality/Onboard-SDK-4.0/settings/actions)
1. Any queues actions should be processed.
